# Reviewing Web3 Audit Reports

Every finding gets a PoC test. The test determines truth, not the auditor's claims.

This skill orchestrates auditing review sessions. Subagents do the per-finding work — the orchestrator sets up, dispatches, tracks state, and generates the final scorecard.

## When to Use

- Reviewing a smart contract audit report against the audited codebase
- Creating PoC tests for smart contract audit findings
- Producing a scorecard grading audit accuracy

## When NOT to Use

- Implementing fixes for findings (use `resolving-audit-findings`)
- Combining several campaigns into one deduplicated set (use `aggregating-audit-campaigns`)
- Initial security review with no existing audit report — this skill requires a
  third-party report to validate and has no discovery mode of its own
- Code quality or gas optimization review

## Rationalizations (Do Not Skip)

| Rationalization                                     | Why It's Wrong                         | Required Action                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| "The auditor is reputable, so the finding is valid" | Reputation ≠ correctness               | Write a PoC — let code decide                        |
| "I'll accept the severity as stated"                | Auditors inflate severity              | Assess independently using rubric                    |
| "The test is too hard to write"                     | Hard-to-test claims are often wrong    | Simplify setup; flag for manual review if impossible |
| "I already know this is valid/invalid"              | Prior belief is not evidence           | Write the test regardless                            |
| "I'll batch the artifacts and present later"        | Artifacts may be lost if session fails | Save to disk immediately                             |
| "The agent can return the full test code"           | Full code causes context explosion     | Agents save to disk, return 1-line summary only      |
| "I'll run Phase 0 inline to keep it simple"         | Phase 0 reads 100KB+ reports + codebase | Phase 0 runs in a subagent; orchestrator starts empty |
| "The happy path works, so the finding is wrong"     | Edge cases are where bugs hide          | Test the auditor's exact scenario, then all edges     |
| "It's not a real bug, so I'll just dispute it"      | Code quality issues deserve recognition | Use Confirmed (Informational) — see SEVERITY_REFERENCE |
| "The internal function IS the bug, so I'll test it directly" | Testing internals proves the function misbehaves, not that the bug is reachable through the contract | Route through the contract's public/external entry points |
| "I can't reach the bug through entry points"        | That is evidence the bug may not be exploitable as claimed | Classify as Disputed (unreachable) if no entry point path exists |

## Inputs

| Input                 | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Audit report path** | Path to the audit report file. Required — ask if not provided.                         |

## Phase 0: Setup (Subagent)

**Phase 0 runs entirely inside a subagent** to keep the orchestrator's context empty for Phase 1 dispatch. The orchestrator dispatches one setup agent and receives back only the path to the initialized STATE.md.

### Setup Agent Instructions

Dispatch a single `general-purpose` agent with this task:

> You are the setup agent for an audit review session. Perform ALL of the following steps, save outputs to disk, and return a 1-line summary.
>
> 1. **Verify the working tree is clean** — run `git status --porcelain`. If it prints
>    anything, STOP and return `SETUP_BLOCKED|dirty_worktree|<n> changed paths`. Do not
>    discard the user's uncommitted work; it is not this skill's to discard.
> 2. **Checkout audited commit** — only on a clean tree: `git checkout {commit_hash}`.
>    Do not run `git stash`: stashing silently moves the user's uncommitted work aside
>    and this skill never restores it. If the tree is dirty, step 1 already halted.
> 3. **Read the full audit report** at `{report_path}`
> 4. **Discover the testing stack** — detect framework, existing test patterns, shared fixtures, build commands. Dispatch up to **2 Explore agents in parallel**: one for source structure + contract architecture, one for test stack + existing fixtures.
> 5. **Select the test pattern file and PoC filename** — match the project's framework:
>    - Foundry/Forge → `test_patterns/foundry.sol`, PoC filename: `POC.sol`
>    - Hardhat → `test_patterns/hardhat.ts`, PoC filename: `POC.ts`
>    - Ape → `test_patterns/ape.py`, PoC filename: `POC.py`
>    (Brownie is detected as Ape — both are Python/pytest projects. There is no separate
>    Brownie pattern file; see the support matrix in the README.)
> 6. **Verify the test directory** — check build config for where tests live
> 7. **Create finding list** with line offsets for the report file:
>
>    | ID  | Title | Severity | Validity | Affected File(s) | Report Lines  |
>    | --- | ----- | -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
>    | ... | ...   | ...      | ...      | ...              | {start}-{end} |
>
> 8. **Derive report slug** — compact directory name from report filename and commit hash: `{description}-{commit_hash}` (e.g., `savant-ai-scan-1eb2f41d`)
> 9. **Create output directory** `{test_dir}/audit_review/{report_slug}/findings/`
> 10. **Initialize STATE.md** — write to `{test_dir}/audit_review/{report_slug}/STATE.md` using the [State Protocol](#state-protocol) format
> 11. **Return** a single line: `SETUP_COMPLETE|{state_md_path}|{framework}|{test_pattern_path}|{poc_filename}|{total_findings}|{report_slug}`

### After Setup Agent Returns

The orchestrator:
0. If the result starts with `SETUP_BLOCKED|dirty_worktree`, **stop**. Report to the user
   that the target repository has uncommitted changes and that the skill will not
   discard them. Ask the user to commit, stash, or abandon their changes themselves,
   then re-run. Do not attempt to clean the tree on the user's behalf.
1. Parses the 1-line result to extract `state_md_path`, `framework`, `test_pattern_path`, `poc_filename`, `total_findings`, `report_slug`
2. Requests write permissions for `{test_dir}/audit_review/{report_slug}/`
3. Proceeds directly to Phase 1 — **do not re-read the audit report or explore the codebase**

---

## Phase 1: Dispatch and Track

### State Protocol

All session state lives on disk in `{test_dir}/audit_review/{report_slug}/STATE.md`. The orchestrator reads this file at the start of each batch cycle. This keeps orchestrator context flat regardless of how many findings are processed.

**STATE.md format:**

```markdown
# Session State

**Report:** {report_path}
**Commit:** {hash}
**Test Pattern:** {test_pattern_path}
**Framework:** {Foundry | Hardhat | Ape}
**Total Findings:** {N}
**Processed:** {count}
**Remaining:** {count}

## Processed Findings

{ID}|{Status}|{Auditor Severity}|{Assessed Severity}|{Score}|{Validity Conf}|{Severity Conf}|{Summary}[|{validation notes if any}]
...

## Remaining Findings

| ID  | Title | Severity | Validity | Report Lines |
| --- | ----- | -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| ... | ...   | ...      | ...      | ...          |
```

### Dispatch Loop — Background Agents with Disk-Based State

All 3 agents run in **background**. The orchestrator detects completion by reading `RESULT` files from disk — never by calling `TaskOutput` (which dumps agent transcripts into orchestrator context, causing context explosion).

#### Dispatch Cycle

1. **Read STATE.md** — get the current processed/remaining state
2. **Count existing RESULT files** — run `ls findings/*/RESULT 2>/dev/null | wc -l` to establish baseline count before this batch
3. **Mark IN_PROGRESS** — for up to 3 findings from Remaining (respecting grouping rules), move them from the Remaining table to the Processed section with status `IN_PROGRESS`:
   ```
   {ID}|IN_PROGRESS|||||||dispatched
   ```
4. **Dispatch all 3 agents in background** (`run_in_background: true`) — construct each prompt from [SUBAGENT_PROMPT.md](SUBAGENT_PROMPT.md) with template variables:
   - `{test_pattern_path}` → absolute path to the framework's test pattern file
   - `{severity_reference_path}` → absolute path to SEVERITY_REFERENCE.md
   - `{output_dir}` → `{test_dir}/audit_review/{report_slug}/findings/{finding_id}/`
   - `{report_path}` → path to audit report
   - `{report_lines}` → line range for this finding
   - `{finding_id}` → the finding's ID
   - `{report_name}` → name of the audit report
   - `{poc_filename}` → PoC test filename for the detected framework (`POC.sol`, `POC.ts`, or `POC.py`)
   - `{processed_findings}` → pipe-delimited lines from STATE.md (for duplicate detection)
5. **Launch a background file watcher** (`run_in_background: true`) — a single Bash command that exits when 2+ new RESULT files appear:
   ```bash
   target=$((existing + 2))
   while true; do
     current=$(ls findings/*/RESULT 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
     if [ "$current" -ge "$target" ]; then
       echo "READY: $current results (target was $target)"
       break
     fi
     sleep 30
   done
   ```
   Replace `existing` with the actual baseline count. This is **one** command per batch, and it reports progress to the same transcript the user can read.
6. **Do bookkeeping while waiting** — prepare next batch's prompts from STATE.md, pre-create output directories with `mkdir -p`
7. **Wait for watcher** — call `TaskOutput(watcher_task_id, block=true, timeout=600000)`. This blocks until 2+ agents complete and does not itself require a tool permission.
8. **Read new RESULT files** — Glob `findings/*/RESULT`, read each new one, match against IN_PROGRESS entries
9. **Update STATE.md** — replace IN_PROGRESS lines with results, update Processed/Remaining counters
10. **Refill and repeat** — dispatch next batch to refill slots to 3

#### Why This Architecture

| Problem | Old Approach | New Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Context explosion | `TaskOutput` dumps full agent transcripts (compilation logs, bash progress) into orchestrator | Orchestrator reads 1-line RESULT files from disk |
| Idle waiting | Fixed batches wait for slowest agent | Refill at 2/3 completion keeps slots occupied |
| State loss on crash | Agent results only in memory until STATE.md update | RESULT files persist on disk immediately |
| Concurrent writes | N/A | Each agent writes to its own `findings/{id}/RESULT` — no contention |
| Polling cost | Foreground `sleep && ls` issues one command per poll and adds a message to context each time | One background watcher per batch, read once via `TaskOutput` |

#### Background File Watcher

Instead of foreground polling (which issues a command and a context message per poll), use a **single background bash command** per batch cycle. Launch it with `run_in_background: true` immediately after dispatching agents. Read it with `TaskOutput` after doing bookkeeping.

**Never use foreground `sleep` for polling.** A foreground sleep costs a round-trip and a context message per poll. The background watcher does the same work in one call, and its output is still recorded in the session transcript — nothing about it is hidden from the user.

### Grouping Rules

- Findings touching the **same file** go in **different dispatch slots** (avoid conflicting writes)
- Findings touching **different files** can share concurrent slots
- Never exceed **3 concurrent agents**

### Post-Batch Validation

After collecting RESULT files for each batch, verify artifact completeness on disk:

| Classification | Required Files |
|---|---|
| Confirmed / Confirmed (overstated) | `RESULT` AND `ISSUE.md` AND `POC.{ext}` |
| Disputed | `RESULT` AND `DISPUTE.md` AND `POC.{ext}` |
| Duplicate | `RESULT` AND `DUPLICATE.md` only (no PoC needed) |

**Validation order:** Check `RESULT` first (agent completed), then markdown artifact (most important deliverable), then PoC file. Subagents are instructed to write markdown before PoC, so a missing PoC with a present ISSUE.md/DISPUTE.md is more recoverable than the reverse.

For any missing artifact, append `MISSING:{filename}` to the finding's result line in STATE.md. If more than 2 findings in a batch have missing artifacts, investigate whether the subagent prompt template variables were filled correctly before continuing.

### Context Management

- The orchestrator's context stays flat: it only holds STATE.md contents + the current batch's 1-line results
- Agent results are 1-line summaries — full artifacts are on disk
- If context pressure grows, stop and suggest continuing in a new session with the remaining STATE.md
- If an agent fails, log the failure in STATE.md and continue — do not retry

## Phase 2: Final Scorecard

After all findings are processed, generate `{test_dir}/audit_review/{report_slug}/SCORECARD.md`.

Read all result lines from STATE.md. For confirmed findings, read the ISSUE.md to get quality dimension scores.

**Self-identified invalid findings:** If the audit report includes auditor validity labels (e.g., `Validity: Invalid`), findings the auditor self-identified as invalid are **excluded from the quality score** and listed in a separate section. These represent correct self-assessment and should not penalize audit quality. Add a `Self-identified invalid (correct)` row to the category table with the count, split the findings summary into scored and self-identified sections, and compute the score over only the scored findings.

**Scorecard structure:**

```markdown
# Audit Review Scorecard: {Report Name}

**Commit:** {hash}
**Total Findings:** {N} ({scored} scored, {self_invalid} self-identified invalid)
**Audit Quality Score: {XX.XX} / 100** (scored findings only)

| Category                        | Count | Percentage |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Confirmed (severity accurate)   | X     | X%         |
| Confirmed (severity overstated) | X     | X%         |
| Disputed                        | X     | X%         |
| Duplicate                       | X     | X%         |
| Self-identified invalid (correct)| X     | —          |

## Scored Findings Summary

Sorted: Disputed first, then confirmed by assessed severity (Critical → Low).
Only includes findings the auditor did not self-identify as invalid.

| ID  | Title | Auditor Severity | Status | Assessed Severity | Finding Score | Validity Confidence | Severity Confidence |
| --- | ----- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| ... | ...   | ...              | ...    | ...               | ...           | ...                 | ...                 |

## Score Calculation

Severity weights: Critical=8, High=4, Medium=2, Low=1, Info=0.
Weight = max(auditor severity weight, assessed severity weight).
Formula: contribution = (weight / total_weight) × 100 × (score / 5)
Only scored findings are included — self-identified invalid findings are excluded.

| ID        | Severity Weight | Share of 100 | Finding Score | Contribution |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| ...       | ...             | ...          | ...           | ...          |
| **Total** | {total}         |              |               | **{final}**  |
```

## Output Directory Structure

```
{test_dir}/audit_review/
  {report_slug}/                    ← one directory per report (e.g., savant-ai-scan-1eb2f41d/)
    STATE.md                        ← session state (orchestrator reads/writes)
    SCORECARD.md                    ← final scorecard (Phase 2)
    findings/
      {finding_id}/
        RESULT                      ← 1-line completion signal (agent writes, orchestrator reads)
        POC.{ext}                   ← confirmed AND disputed findings (NOT duplicates)
        ISSUE.md                    ← confirmed findings
        DISPUTE.md                  ← disputed findings
        DUPLICATE.md                ← duplicate findings (no POC needed)
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                              | Prevention                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Not reading STATE.md each iteration                  | Always read STATE.md before dispatching              |
| Keeping agent results in orchestrator memory         | Append to STATE.md, discard from context             |
| Processing multiple reports in one session           | One report per session                               |
| Agents returning full code in responses              | Agents save to disk, return 1-line summary           |
| Batching multiple findings per agent                 | One finding per agent                                |
| Not filling template variables in SUBAGENT_PROMPT.md | Check all `{variables}` are resolved before dispatch |
| Skipping duplicate detection context                 | Always pass processed findings to agents             |
| Running Phase 0 inline (context explosion)           | Phase 0 runs in a subagent; orchestrator stays empty |
| Agents returning self-validation in response         | SUBAGENT_PROMPT enforces 1-line; validate on disk    |
| Missing markdown artifacts after agent completes     | Post-batch validation checks files exist on disk     |
| Duplicate findings writing unnecessary PoC tests     | SUBAGENT_PROMPT says "skip all remaining steps"      |
| Calling TaskOutput to check agent status             | Read RESULT files from disk — TaskOutput dumps full transcripts into context |
| Using foreground sleep+poll for RESULT detection     | Launch a single background file watcher per batch; foreground polling requires per-command approval and inflates context |
| Testing only the happy path                          | SUBAGENT_PROMPT requires testing auditor's exact scenario + all edges |
| Disputing code quality issues as false positives     | Use Confirmed (Informational) for real quality issues with no security impact |
| Testing internal functions directly (library calls, custom harnesses, reimplemented math) | SUBAGENT_PROMPT bans internal-direct testing; Check 6 enforces |
| Using harness `exposed_` as primary exercise action  | `exposed_` functions are for setup/assertion only, not primary exercise |
